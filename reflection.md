# Major Project Reflection by Jacky

## The Most Challenging Part

The most challenging part of the whole project was the calculations of mine next to the selected square. It took me almost a week to get the calculations correct. The reason for this is because I didn't know what was wrong. When I first used the code, I copied the same code I used for the grid-base assignment. However, it didn't work. It was until the second day I decided to redo the whole code and due to my sloppiness, the code was working after 4-5 readings.


## Anything you would do differently if you started now?
Yes. After this project, I fully understand the usage of objects. If I had this knowledge to begin with, it would've saved me a lot more time. Instead of creating two different maps and then change it to one object map, I can just create the object map. Doing this, I can used the time I spent on translating the 2 map into 1 on something else.

## What are you most proud of?
Everything. Minesweeper is a game that my family and play often. Being able to recreate this game with my own hands is shocking and exciting. Now everytime we play Minesweeper, my family can play the one I made instead. However, if I had to pick something that made me proud in the project, it will be the help tab. Even though the help tab is not important to minesweeper, it was like the cherry on top. Also, the help tab will also introduce more players to the minesweeper commmunity - if they ever use my game. The idea of help tab came from my friends. I have talked to many people about this project but most of the people I have talked to don't exactly know how to play minesweeper. Therefore, I added the help tab for new players. Another thing that I am most proud of is the adddition of the timer and high score. This made the game competitive.
