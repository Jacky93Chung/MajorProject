# Project Proposal

## Description

My project is MineSweeper - A classic window desktop game. In this project, I hope I will have a functional Minesweeper game that I will be able to play with my brother in the future. Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.


## Need to Have List

- Main Menu
    - 3 Different Level of Difficulty
        - Easy 
        - Medium
        - Hard

- Grid is able to respond to different click commands from the Mouse 
    - Right Click = Place Flag
    - Right Click Again = Remove Flag
    - Left Click = Dig Square
    - Left Click (if bomb) = Blow Up 

- Make the 2 2D-array into 1 with object

- Detect the user has won when all non-mine squares are clicked

- A timer to caculate how long it takes user to finish

- Flag Display (Tell users how many bombs there are in the whole grid)
